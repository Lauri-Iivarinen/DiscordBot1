# DiscordBot1

Personal project for fun!

*main.js(and commands/ping.js) is mainly template from Discord.js guide*

Asking friends for command suggestion and then creating them as best as I can :)

Implemented commands (in order of implementation):
  - /roll rolls number from 1-100
  - /cat fetches gif of a cat from giphy
  - /cursed fetches an image from the frontpage of r/cursedcomments
  - /split x (this rocks!) gets the users current voicechannel and subdivides all channel members into smaller groups which are assigned a new voicechannnel (automatically transferred)
